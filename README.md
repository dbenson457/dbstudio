DBStudio: My Final Year University Project
==========================================

DBStudio started as my final-year university project, where the original idea was to build a web application to teach users how to play musical instruments. The plan was to use online videos as the primary teaching method, paired with interactive quizzes designed to reinforce the material covered in the videos. These resources would be organized into structured courses, making it easier for users to follow a step-by-step learning path.

The project was an exciting challenge, combining my interests in education, technology, and design. Although the application eventually evolved into a database management tool, the initial concept reflects my passion for creating innovative learning platforms and using technology to help people achieve their goals.
